- 👋 Hi, I’m Olga.
  Having been just an Analyst for about 10 years, I've started to develop as a Data Analyst. I got a [certificate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qrSX1EBxP5XmAJ1iQJb29BgYcVp5rJU0/view?usp=sharing) in Data Analytics and I'm now seeking for job offers in Data Analysis worldwide.
 

- 👩‍💻 I'd like to get the experience in Data Analysis to become a professional.
- 🌏 I’m open to relocation to EU or anywhere where I'll be a good fit.
- Don't hesitate to reach me out via:
